[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/securitydaemons/sdmfle-automation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/securitydaemons/sdmfle-automation)

This repository contains infrastructure automation tooling developed for the Security Daemons Multi-Faceted Laboratory Environment.

## Project Overview
The Security Daemons Multi-Faceted Laboratory Environment (abbreviated as SDMFLE) is an open-source project that facilitates a horizontally scalable and isolated cyber range on which a number of cybersecurity exercises can be conducted upon. The primary benefits are twofold: to evaluate a user's practical knowledge of  application and host security, and reinforce theoretical concepts obtained through formal education.
